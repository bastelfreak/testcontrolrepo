Type=exec
# We hardcode the params file in ExecStart, so we need to ensure it exists always,
# even for plans that don't accept any parameters. Problem is, bolt expects a valid json file :sadface:
#ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/touch @<%= $project_path %>/%i.json
ExecStart=/opt/puppetlabs/bin/bolt plan run %i --params @<%= $project_path %>/%i.json
User=<%= $user %>
Group=<%= $group %>
WorkingDirectory=<%= $project_path %>
# don't add RemainAfterExit, then we cannot tracke the state via puppet anymore after bolt started
